# pandas-school-analysis

This challenge examines statistical data from the PyCity school district, which contains 15 individual schools and approximately twenty-four thousand students. This challenge drills down the aggregate information provided into useful data tables that concern grade averages, per capita spending, school type, and other variables.

The primary analytical tool being used in this challenge is Python Pandas. To install and run the code, use VS Code or other Pandas-friendly software and adjust as needed if using a Mac computer.

Aside from some advice and collaboration with fellow students, the code contained herein is my own work.
